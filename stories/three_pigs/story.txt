Once upon a time there were three little pigs. The first little pig built his house of straw. The second little pig built his house of sticks. The third little pig built his house of bricks.

One day, the big bad wolf came. He went to the first house and huffed and puffed and blew the house down. The little pig ran to the second house.

The wolf then came to the second house. He huffed and puffed and blew the house down. The two little pigs ran to the third house.

The wolf then came to the third house. He huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed, but he could not blow the house down. The wolf gave up and the three little pigs lived happily ever after.
