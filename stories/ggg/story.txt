Jasper and Daphne lived in a small, cozy house near the edge of Willow Creek. Their two dogs, Dingo and Hudson, were digging in the yard.
One bright morning, a distraught neighbor rushed to their door. "The well water! It's turned sweet," she cried. "And it's whispering!"
Jasper grabbed his notebook, and Daphne strapped on her walking boots. "We will investigate," Daphne declared. "Come on, Dingo and Hudson!"

The foursome walked down to the town square. The ancient stone well stood at the center. A faint, sweet scent hung in the air, and a tiny, high-pitched *wisp* could be heard.
Jasper leaned in close. "The whispering sounds like singing," he observed. Dingo and Hudson sniffed anxiously at the well's edge, their tails still.
Daphne noticed a faint, shimmering trail of dust leading away from the well and towards the old, abandoned mill. "Look," she whispered.
They followed the trail. Dingo, the smaller dog, kept his nose low to the ground, tracking the mysterious dust. Hudson, the big dog, guarded their flanks.

At the old mill, they found the source. Not a monster, but a small colony of mischievous, glowing sprites. They were pouring sweet, magically enhanced honey into the mill race, which fed the well.
The sprites stopped their singing and stared. "We only wanted to make the water taste nicer!" squeaked the smallest sprite.
Jasper smiled. "It's too much honey for the whole town," he explained kindly. Daphne showed them a nearby patch of flowers. "You can put your sweet magic here instead, to make the flowers bloom all year."
The sprites agreed happily. They redirected their magic, and the sweet scent left the well. Jasper, Daphne, Dingo, and Hudson walked home, heroes of Willow Creek.
